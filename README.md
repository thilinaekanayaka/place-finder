# Place Finder

  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can search for places in the search box and it will display the locations in the map using markers.

The map has "Map" and "Satellite" view switching and even Google Street View. Drag the Pegman on to the map to open Street View.

Use the "Recent Locations" list to jump to the most recent map markers.
